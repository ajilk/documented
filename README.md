document custom documents using custom fields

---
## Idea
Main process opens the form.yaml that specifies which fields to render.
Takes the form fields and sends it to the render to render the specified fields.

## Features
- listView of imported forms
- navbar for form title and actions 
	- ex. load, submit, close form 
	- fixed navbar
	- (load only form at a time, load -> close)
	- submit = enter (no submit button) -> opens dialog to ask save location
- render obtained data in markdown and pdf
